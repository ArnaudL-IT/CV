abstract = "We have developed a position response calibration method for a micro-channel plate (MCP) detector with a delay-line anode position readout scheme. Using an in situ calibration mask, an accuracy of 8µm and a resolution of 85µm (FWHM) have been achieved for MeV-scale α particles and ions with energies of ∼10keV. At this level of accuracy, the difference between the MCP position responses to high-energy α particles and low-energy ions is significant. The improved performance of the MCP detector can find applications in many fields of AMO and nuclear physics. In our case, it helps reducing systematic uncertainties in a high-precision nuclear β-decay experiment."

  abstract={Correlations between β decay products are sensitive observables to look for exotic contributions to the weak interaction excluded by the Standard Model of particle physics. To precisely measure the β – v angular correlation parameter, α βν , in 6 He β decay, the radioactive atoms are trapped in a magneto-optical trap and the momentum of β particles and 6 Li recoil ions are measured in coincidence. The shake-off process, leading to higher charge states of the Li, plays an important role in this observation and must be studied carefully. Its study provides stringent tests of the sudden approximation for atomic calculations in this few electron system.}

This result is understood in term of impact parameter from which the electrons are captured on the projectile.}
